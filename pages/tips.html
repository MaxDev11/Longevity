                    Eat a combination of different foods, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole grains. <br>
                    Adults should eat at least five portions (400g) of fruit and vegetables per day. <br>
                    You can improve your intake of fruits and vegetables by always including veggies in your meal; <br> 
                    eating fresh fruit and vegetables as snacks; eating a variety of fruits and vegetables; <br>
                    and eating them in season. By eating healthy, you will reduce your risk of malnutrition and <br>
                    noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer. <br>

                    Filipinos consume twice the recommended amount of sodium, putting them at risk of high blood pressure, <br>
                    which in turn increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. Most people get their sodium through <br>
                    salt. Reduce your salt intake to 5g per day, equivalent to about one teaspoon. It’s easier to do <br>
                    this by limiting the amount of salt, soy sauce, fish sauce and other high-sodium condiments when <br>
                    preparing meals; removing salt, seasonings and condiments from your meal table; avoiding salty <br>
                    snacks; and choosing low-sodium products. <br>

                <p class="main-details__text">
                    Fats consumed should be less than 30% of your total energy intake. This will help prevent unhealthy <br>
                    weight gain and NCDs. There are different types of fats, but unsaturated fats are preferable over <br>
                    saturated fats and trans-fats. WHO recommends reducing saturated fats to less than 10% of total energy <br>
                    intake; reducing trans-fats to less than 1% of total energy intake; and replacing both saturated fats <br>
                    and trans-fats to unsaturated fats. <br>

                    There is no safe level for drinking alcohol. Consuming alcohol can lead to health problems such as mental <br>

                    Smoking tobacco causes NCDs such as lung disease, heart disease and stroke. Tobacco kills not only the direct <br>
                    smokers but even non-smokers through second-hand exposure. Currently, there are around 15.9 million Filipino <br>
                    adults who smoke tobacco but 7 in 10 smokers are interested or plan to quit. <br>

                    Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. <br>
                    This includes exercise and activities undertaken while working, playing, carrying out household chores, travelling, <br>
                    and engaging in recreational pursuits. The amount of physical activity you need depends on your age group but adults <br>
                    aged 18-64 years should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week. <br>
                    Increase moderate-intensity physical activity to 300 minutes per week for additional health benefits. <br>

                <p class="main-details__text"> 
                    Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is called a “silent killer”. This is because many people who have hypertension may not <br>
                    be aware of the problem as it may not have any symptoms. If left uncontrolled, hypertension can lead to heart, brain, kidney <br>
                    and other diseases. Have your blood pressure checked regularly by a health worker so you know your numbers. <br>
                    If your blood pressure is high, get the advice of a health worker. This is vital in the prevention and control of hypertension. <br>

                    Getting yourself tested is an important step in knowing your health status, especially when it comes to HIV, hepatitis B, <br>
                    sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) and tuberculosis (TB). Left untreated, these diseases can lead to serious complications <br> 
                    and even death. Knowing your status means you will know how to either continue preventing these diseases or, if you find out <br>
                    that you’re positive, get the care and treatment that you need. Go to a public or private health facility, wherever you are <br>
                    comfortable, to have yourself tested <br>

                    Drinking unsafe water can lead to water-borne diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio. Globally, <br>
                    at least 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces. Check with your water concessionaire and water <br>
                    refilling station to ensure that the water you’re drinking is safe. In a setting where you are unsure of your water source, <br>
                    boil your water for at least one minute. This will destroy harmful organisms in the water. Let it cool naturally before drinking. <br>

                    Unsafe food containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances, causes more than 200 diseases – ranging from diarrhoea <br>
                    to cancers. When buying food at the market or store, check the labels or the actual produce to ensure it is safe to eat. If you are preparing <br>
                    food, make sure you follow the Five Keys to Safer Food: (1) keep clean; (2) separate raw and cooked; (3) cook thoroughly; (4) keep food at safe <br>

                <p class="main-details__text">
                    One of the biggest benefits of running is that it's good for your health. Running is an excellent way <br>
                    to strengthen the heart and ensure the efficient flow of blood and oxygen throughout the body, <br>
                    which helps decrease your risk of a heart attack. <br>
                    <br>
                    Exercise, combined with maintaining a healthy weight, is one of the best ways to naturally reduce <br>
                    your blood pressure if it's above normal. If you have high cholesterol, running can also help keep <br>
                    it in check. Running and other weight-bearing exercises also increase bone density, which can fend <br>
                    off osteoporosis. <br>
                    <br>
                    Including running into your fitness routine can also improve your immune system, so your body is <br>
                    more effective and efficient at fighting off germs. <br>
