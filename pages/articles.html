                <summary class="main-details__sum" id="article1" style="cursor: pointer;">1. Changes in the immune system can promote healthy aging</summary>
                <p class="main-details__text">
                    As we age, the immune system gradually becomes impaired. <br>
                    <br>
                    One aspect of this impairment is chronic inflammation in the elderly, which means that <br>
                    the immune system is constantly active and sends out inflammatory substances. <br>
                    <br>
                    Such chronic inflammation is associated with multiple age-related diseases including <br>
                    arthritis and Alzheimer's disease, and impaired immune responses to infection. <br>
                    <br>
                    One of the questions in ageing research is whether chronic inflammation <br> 
                    is a cause of ageing, or a consequence of the ageing process itself? <br>
                    <br>
                    Scientists in the laboratory of Director Adam Antebi at the Max Planck Institute <br> 
                    for Biology of Ageing in Cologne, Germany have found evidence suggesting <br>
                    that increased inflammation causes the ageing process to speed up, and that <br>
                    there is a fine balance between maintaining immune system function and longevity. <br>

                <summary class="main-details__sum" id="article2" style="cursor: pointer;">2. How You Can Increase Your Longevity</summary>
                <p class="main-details__text">
                    You may think that your genes determine your longevity, <br>
                    but the truth is genetics account for a maximum of 30 percent of your life expectancy. <br> 
                    The rest comes from your behaviors, attitudes, environment, and a little bit of luck. <br>
                    <br>
                    You may have heard about various life extension techniques. <br>
                    Keep in mind that none of them have been proven in humans and most are just theories. <br> 
                    The only proven way to live longer is to live a healthy life. <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Ways To Maximize Your Longevity</strong> <br>
                        <br>
                        1. Exercise regularly. Research indicates that moderate exercise, <br>
                        when practiced regularly, can actually roll back the clock on your DNA. <br>
                        <br>
                        2. Fill up your plate with vegetables. While there are numerous debates <br>
                        about the best diet for increased lifespan, nearly every diet agrees that <br>
                        eating more vegetables is the way to go. <br>
                        <br>
                        3. Consider intermittent fasting (with many variations on how this is achieved). <br> 
                        Fasting has been shown to significantly extend the life (and improve health) of mice. <br> 
                        Studies dating as far back as the 1930s have shown that caloric restriction extends the <br>
                        longevity of mice and other test species. <br>
                        <br>
                        4. A study published in Cell Metabolism in 2018 looked at 53 non obese human adults over a 2 year period. <br>
                        The test group restricted calories by 15%. Metabolic studies showed that the test group had evidence of less <br>
                        oxidative stress/damage compared to the control group. <br>
                        <br>
                        5. Get enough sleep. Most people feel best when they get seven to nine hours of sleep a night. <br>
                        <br>
                        6. Carefully manage your stress. Stress can have unhealthy effects on your body and can promote <br>
                        unhealthy behaviors, as well, such as overeating or smoking. <br>
                        <br>
                        7. Cultivate personal relationships. Spending time with our loved ones actually <br>
                        does seem to improve longevity, maybe because it decreases stress or risky behaviors. <br>
                        <br>
                        8. Don't smoke or drink excessive amounts of alcohol. <br>
                        <br>

                    While our lifespan is partially influenced by our genetics, it’s really only a small part. <br>
                    “Only 20 percent of our lifespan is determined by our parents,” Dr. Sinclair tells us. <br>
                    “The rest is up to us.” <br>
                    <br>
                    Consider, for instance, that life expectancy in the US has increased by almost twenty years <br>
                    just in the last fifty years. Our genes haven’t changed, but our lifestyles and environments have. <br> 
                    Indeed, advances in modern medicine have come a long way in eradicating deaths from diseases. <br>
                    Dr. Sinclair’s lab works on how we can improve longevity even after you remove diseases from the equation. <br>
                    <br>
                    “Even if we stopped cancer and heart disease individually today, we would only live another couple of years <br>
                    because we come up against aging itself. The only way to make meaningful gains in health and longevity is to <br>
                    address the root causes of these diseases, which is aging itself.” To do so, Dr. Sinclair’s lab investigates how <br>
                    our genes can best express themselves for optimal longevity. <br>

                    Dr. Sinclair’s research on longevity isn’t just about extending our lifespan by the numbers. <br>
                    It’s about improving our quality of life at these older ages. <br>
                    <br>
                    “One misconception is that research like mine will keep people in nursing homes for longer because <br>
                    they imagine what it’s like to be ninety. But what we’re talking about is actually keeping people <br>
                    younger for longer so they will not have to go into nursing homes,” he shares. “People aren’t scared of <br>
                    getting old. They’re scared of losing their health, and their humanity.” <br>

                <p class="main-details__text">
                    Modern living is very comfortable, but a little discomfort can actually encourage greater longevity. <br>
                    <br>
                    “We’ve realized that all life on the planet does better when it thinks we’re under threat of survival, <br> 
                    or perceived adversity,” Dr. Sinclair shares. “In our lab, we call it hormesis. It’s the scientific <br>
                    term for ‘whatever doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger—and live longer.’ What it essentially means <br>
                    is that we have these in-built protective systems, longevity genes, and they are only activated when <br>
                    we’re hungry, or exercising, or doing something that tricks our bodies into thinking times will be tough.” <br>
                    <br>
                    In his personal routine, Dr. Sinclair exercises regularly and tries to skip one meal a day. <br>

                <summary class="main-details__sum" id="article6" style="cursor: pointer;">6. Eat more plants... and drink red wine</summary>
                <p class="main-details__text">
                    “There’s a set of longevity genes that are helpful when you don’t have a lot of meat,” Dr. Sinclair explains. <br>
                    For example, a longevity pathway called nTor is sensitive to the number of amino acids that come into the body. <br>
                    In particular, to some of the branched-chain amino acids that are more abundant in animal products. <br>
                    <br>
                    “What’s good about having low levels of branched-chain amino acids is, first of all, you’ll probably be less <br>
                    hungry. But second of all, you’ll turn on those nTor defensive pathways that, at least in the lab, extends <br>
                    lifespan of animals quite dramatically—even late in life when it’s applied.” <br>
                    <br>
                    Plants have another resiliency benefit. “They make molecules that turn on their own defenses,” he shares. <br>
                    <br>
                    “We have a theory called xenohormesis and that’s the idea that stressed plants make molecules that help them, <br>
                    but also when we eat those plants we turn on our defenses.” In following this theory, eating stressed plants <br>
                    that have been exposed to a lot of sun before harvest can help activate our body’s natural defenses. <br>
                    <br>
                    “The best example is resveratrol in grapes. We bottle that in red wine and we’ve found resveratrol activates <br>
                    a particular longevity pathway in the body. That’s in part why we think red wine over the long run can be healthy.” <br>

                    The best time to start implementing anti-aging tactics is right now, no matter your age. Of course, the earlier <br>
                    you can start, the better. However, “It’s never really too late,” Dr. Sinclair reassures us. A prime example? His father. <br>
                    <br>
                    “My father has been implementing changes and he’s now 80,” he shares. “He has small meals, he focuses on plants, <br>
                    he eats dark, green, leafy vegetables and isn’t looking back at all.” Even at his advanced age, his father is as <br>
                    physically fit as someone in their 20s or 30s. <br>
                    <br>
                    “If we can eat the right things, and move a little bit, that’s already a big change in people’s lives. It’s all <br>
                    those simple things that we need to start with, and then add the science on top of that. That’s why I’m optimistic <br>
                    that it’s doable. The only thing that’s holding us back is the will to do it.” <br>

                    The link between calorie intake and longevity currently generates a lot of interest. <br>
                    <br>
                    Animal studies suggest that a 10–50% reduction in normal calorie intake may increase maximum lifespan. <br>
                    <br>
                    Studies of human populations renowned for longevity also observe links between low calorie intake, <br> 
                    an extended lifespan, and a lower likelihood of disease. <br>
                    <br>
                    What’s more, calorie restriction may help reduce excess body weight and belly fat, both of which are associated with <br> 
                    shorter lifespans. <br>
                    <br>
                    That said, long-term calorie restriction is often unsustainable and can include negative side effects, such as <br>
                    increased hunger, low body temperature, and a diminished sex drive. <br>
                    <br>
                    Whether calorie restriction slows aging or extends your lifespan is not yet fully understood. <br>

                    Nuts are nutritional powerhouses. <br>
                    <br>
                    They’re rich in protein, fiber, antioxidants, and beneficial plant compounds. What’s more, they’re a great source <br>
                    of several vitamins and minerals, such as copper, magnesium, potassium, folate, niacin, and vitamins B6 and E. <br>
                    <br>
                    Several studies show that nuts have beneficial effects on heart disease, high blood pressure, inflammation, diabetes, <br> 
                    metabolic syndrome, belly fat levels, and even some forms of cancer. <br>
                    <br>
                    One study found that people who consumed at least 3 servings of nuts per week had a 39% lower risk of premature death. <br>
                    <br>
                    Similarly, two recent reviews including over 350,000 people noted that those who ate nuts had a 4–27% lower risk of dying <br>
                    during the study period — with the greatest reductions seen in those who ate 1 serving of nuts per day. <br>

                <p class="main-details__text">
                    When it comes to anti-aging strategies, turmeric is a great option. That’s because this spice contains a potent bioactive <br>
                    compound called curcumin. <br>
                    <br>
                    Due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, curcumin is thought to help maintain brain, heart, and lung function, <br>
                    as well as protect against cancers and age-related diseases. <br>
                    <br>
                    Curcumin is linked to an increased lifespan in both insects and mice. <br>
                    <br>
                    However, these findings have not always been replicated, and no human studies are currently available. <br>
                    <br>
                    Nevertheless, turmeric has been consumed for thousands of years in India and is generally considered safe. <br>

                <summary class="main-details__sum" id="article11" style="cursor: pointer;">11. Eat plenty of healthy plant foods</summary>
                <p class="main-details__text">
                    Consuming a wide variety of plant foods, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and beans, may <br>
                    decrease disease risk and promote longevity. <br>
                    <br>
                    For example, many studies link a plant-rich diet to a lower risk of premature death, as well as a reduced risk of <br>
                    cancer, metabolic syndrome, heart disease, depression, and brain deterioration. <br>
                    <br>
                    These effects are attributed to plant foods’ nutrients and antioxidants, which include polyphenols, carotenoids, <br>
                    folate, and vitamin C. <br>
                    <br>
                    Accordingly, several studies link vegetarian and vegan diets, which are naturally higher in plant foods, to a 12–15% <br>
                    lower risk of premature death. <br>
                    <br>
                    The same studies also report a 29–52% lower risk of dying from cancer or heart, kidney, or hormone-related diseases. <br>
                    <br>
                    What’s more, some research suggests that the risk of premature death and certain diseases increases with greater meat consumption. <br>
                    <br>
                    However, other studies report either nonexistent or much weaker links — with the negative effects seeming specifically <br>
                    linked to processed meat. <br>
                    <br>
                    Vegetarians and vegans also generally tend to be more health-conscious than meat eaters, which could at least partly <br>
                    explain these findings. <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, eating plenty of plant foods is likely to benefit health and longevity. <br>

                <p class="main-details__text">
                    It should come as no surprise that staying physically active can keep you healthy and add years to your life. <br>
                    <br>
                    As few as 15 minutes of exercise per day may help you achieve benefits, which could include an additional 3 years of life. <br>
                    <br>
                    Furthermore, your risk of premature death may decrease by 4% for each additional 15 minutes of daily physical activity. <br>
                    <br>
                    A recent review observed a 22% lower risk of early death in individuals who exercised — even though they worked out less <br>
                    than the recommended 150 minutes per week. <br>
                    <br>
                    People who hit the 150-minute recommendation were 28% less likely to die early. What’s more, that number was 35% for <br>
                    those who exercised beyond this guidance. <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, some research links vigorous activity to a 5% greater reduction in risk compared to low- or moderate-intensity activities. <br>

                    Feeling happy can significantly increase your longevity. <br>
                    <br>
                    In fact, happier individuals had a 3.7% reduction in early death over a 5-year study period. <br>
                    <br>
                    A study of 180 Catholic nuns analyzed their self-reported levels of happiness when they <br>
                    first entered the monastery and later compared these levels to their longevity. <br>
                    <br>
                    Those who felt happiest at 22 years of age were 2.5 times more likely to still <br>
                    be alive six decades later. <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, a review of 35 studies showed that happy people may live up to 18% <br>

                <p class="main-details__text">
                    Anxiety and stress may significantly decrease your lifespan. <br>
                    <br>
                    For instance, women suffering from stress or anxiety are reportedly up to two times more likely <br>
                    to die from heart disease, stroke, or lung cancer. <br>
                    <br>
                    Similarly, the risk of premature death is up to three times higher for anxious or stressed men <br>
                    compared to their more relaxed counterparts. <br>
                    <br>
                    If you’re feeling stressed, laughter and optimism could be two key components of the solution. <br>
                    <br>
                    Studies show that pessimistic individuals have a 42% higher risk of early death than more optimistic people. <br>
                    However, both laughter and a positive outlook on life can reduce stress, potentially prolonging your life. <br>

                <p class="main-details__text">
                    Researchers report that maintaining healthy social networks can help you live up to 50% longer. <br>
                    <br>
                    In fact, having just 3 social ties may decrease your risk of early death by more than 200%. <br>
                    <br>
                    Studies also link healthy social networks to positive changes in heart, brain, hormonal, and immune function, <br>
                    which may decrease your risk of chronic diseases. <br>
                    <br>
                    A strong social circle might also help you react less negatively to stress, perhaps further explaining <br>
                    the positive effect on lifespan. <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, one study reports that providing support to others may be more beneficial than receiving it. <br>

                <p class="main-details__text">
                    Conscientiousness refers to a person’s ability to be self-disciplined, organized, efficient, and goal-oriented. <br>
                    <br>
                    Based on data from a study that followed 1,500 boys and girls into old age, kids who were considered persistent, <br>
                    organized, and disciplined lived 11% longer than their less conscientious counterparts. <br>
                    <br>
                    Conscientious people may also have lower blood pressure and fewer psychiatric conditions, as well as a lower <br>
                    risk of diabetes and heart or joint problems. <br>
                    <br>
                    This might be partly because conscientious individuals are less likely to take dangerous risks or react negatively <br>
                    to stress — and more likely to lead successful professional lives or be responsible about their health. <br>
                    <br>
                    Conscientiousness can be developed at any stage in life through steps as small as tidying up a desk, <br>
                    sticking to a work plan, or being on time. <br>

                <p class="main-details__text">
                    Both coffee and tea are linked to a decreased risk of chronic disease. <br>
                    <br>
                    For instance, the polyphenols and catechins found in green tea may decrease your risk of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. <br>
                    <br>
                    Similarly, coffee is linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers and brain ailments, <br>
                    such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. <br>
                    <br>
                    Additionally, both coffee and tea drinkers benefit from a 20–30% lower risk of early death compared to non-drinkers. <br>
                    <br>
                    Just remember that too much caffeine can also lead to anxiety and insomnia, so you may want to curb your intake to the recommended <br>
                    limit of 400 mg per day — around 4 cups of coffee. <br>
                    <br>
                    It’s also worth noting that it generally takes six hours for caffeine’s effects to subside. Therefore, if you have trouble <br>
                    getting enough high-quality sleep, you may want to shift your intake to earlier in the day. <br>

                <p class="main-details__text">
                    Sleep is crucial for regulating cell function and helping your body heal. <br>
                    <br>
                    A recent study reports that longevity is likely linked to regular sleeping patterns, such as going to bed and waking <br>
                    up around the same time each day. <br>
                    <br>
                    Sleep duration also seems to be a factor, with both too little and too much being harmful. <br>
                    <br>
                    For instance, sleeping less than 5–7 hours per night is linked to a 12% greater risk of early death, while sleeping <br> 
                    more than 8–9 hours per night could also decrease your lifespan by up to 38%. <br>
                    <br>
                    Too little sleep may also promote inflammation and increase your risk of diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. <br> 
                    These are all linked to a shortened lifespan. <br>
                    <br>
                    On the other hand, excessive sleep could be linked to depression, low physical activity, and undiagnosed health conditions, <br>
                    all of which may negatively affect your lifespan. <br>
